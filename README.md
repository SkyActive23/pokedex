This is a simple app project assigned by CareerFoundry. The app is a pokedex that shows all the pokemon ever created from 1 to 1,126. If you need help finding a pokemon just use the searchbar to find it. Once you find the pokemon you are searching for feel free to click on it and learn some cool stuff about them in the modal that will pop up.

The languages used for this project were Javascript, CSS, and HTML
